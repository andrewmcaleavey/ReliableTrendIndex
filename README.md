# ReliableTrendIndex
R package for analysis of "reliable" changes

PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE. The idea of reliable change is extremely questionable, and there are almost certainly better ways to investigate the questions in which you are interested. 

The goal of this package is to provide a simple interface for computing the RCI and RTI given a data set. I intend it for my own personal use and as an educational/demonstration tool in this ongoing research endeavor. 

## Installation
The package should be installable through: 

``` r
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("andrewmcaleavey/ReliableTrendIndex")
```

## Usage  

Really, you could use this package just to have a standard way to access RCI and RTI-like functions. They're not complex, but it is easier to have them in one standard format than bother with always having to re-write these functions with varying levels of stability.  

I repeat, however, that none of these functions should be used for any clinically-meaningful practice: the entire idea of reliable change is facile and should not be taken seriously by any clinician or scientist.
