R package for analysis of "reliable" changes

PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE. The idea of reliable change is extremely questionable, and there are almost certainly better ways to investigate the questions in which you are interested. 

The goal of this package is to provide a simple interface for computing the RCI and RTI given a data set. I intend it for my own personal use and as an educational/demonstration tool in this ongoing research endeavor.
