# ReliableTrendIndex 0.1.0.9000 (development version)

Changed to development version on the main branch. To indicate that this is still a work in progress even though the version number can increment more. 

# ReliableTrendIndex 0.1.0

Initial "release." Indicates that the basic functions now work, even though they may be slow, inefficient, or imperfectly documented. Further development should not overwrite these functions until tested.  

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
